# Assignment 03: Operators

This folder contains SQL scripts focused on the use of **operators** in SQL queries using the `EMP` employee table.

The queries demonstrate various types of SQL operators, including:

- **Arithmetic operators** (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) used in calculations  
- **Comparison operators** (e.g., `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`) to filter rows  
- **Logical operators** (e.g., `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) for combining multiple conditions  
- **Other SQL operators** such as `BETWEEN`, `IN`, and `LIKE`  

These scripts are designed to help you understand and apply different SQL operators to manipulate and retrieve data effectively.

Feel free to explore the queries and experiment with different conditions to deepen your understanding of SQL operator behavior.
