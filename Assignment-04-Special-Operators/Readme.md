# Assignment 04: Special Operators

This folder contains SQL solutions focusing on the use of **special operators** such as:

- `IS NULL`
- `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE`
- `IN` and `NOT IN`
- Logical operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- Pattern matching
- Range filters and date-based conditions

## Overview

The queries are based on employee-related datasets and are designed to:

- Filter records with missing (`NULL`) values
- Match patterns in names using wildcard characters (e.g., `%`, `_`)
- Exclude or include specific departments or job roles
- Apply compound conditions for complex data filtering
- Extract data based on salary range and hire date

## Purpose

All SQL scripts in this folder are aimed at strengthening your understanding of SQLâ€™s filtering and selection capabilities using **special operators**. The problems mimic real-world HR and business scenarios to help you apply SQL practically.

## How to Use

Explore each `.sql` file to understand how the queries are structured. You can run them in any standard SQL environment (e.g., Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL) with an HR-like dataset to observe the output and refine your logic.
