# Assignment 05: Functions & Aggregates

This folder contains SQL solutions focused on the use of **aggregate functions** and **group-based operations** using employee data.

The queries demonstrate the application of functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, and `COUNT()` to derive meaningful insights from employee records. Examples include calculating total and average salaries, counting employees by roles or conditions, and identifying employees based on date or character patterns in their names.

All SQL scripts are aimed at reinforcing your understanding of **SQL aggregate functions** and their role in summarizing and analyzing relational data.

Feel free to explore the SQL files to practice and master aggregate queries for efficient data analysis and reporting.
