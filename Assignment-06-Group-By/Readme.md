# Assignment 06: Group By Clause

This folder contains SQL solutions focused on the use of the `GROUP BY` clause for data aggregation and grouping.

The queries demonstrate how to:
- Group data based on departments, jobs, and salaries
- Apply aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `MAX()`
- Filter grouped data using `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses
- Perform conditional grouping and multi-level aggregation

These exercises help reinforce the understanding of group-based operations in SQL, essential for reporting, analytics, and summarization tasks.

Feel free to explore the SQL scripts to deepen your practical knowledge of how `GROUP BY` is used in real-world SQL scenarios.
